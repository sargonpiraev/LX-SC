# Workflows

There are different approaches of how to manage work and how to deal with rewards for work being done. We introduced several strategies that will allow to be more flexible when cope with payment size:
- Time & Material flow (with confirmation from client's side and without it, so client no need to confirm the begging and end of work);
- Fixed Price flow.

### Time & Material

It is a standard way to treat spent resources and pay for them according to a set up rate. The final amount of resources will be known only after a work will be done. Speaking on a language of contracts this algorithm in its simpliest way looks like this:
1. **client**:> `JobController#postJob()`
2. **worker**:> `JobController#postJobOffer()`
3. **client**:> `JobController#acceptOffer()`
4. **worker**:> `JobController#startWork()`
5. **client**:> `JobController#confirmStartWork()`
6. **worker**:> `JobController#pauseWork()` or `JobController#resumeWork()`
7. **client**:> (could provide additional time to finish work) `JobController#addMoreTime()`
8. **worker**:> `JobController#endWork()`
9. **client**:> `JobController#confirmEndWorking()`
10. **anyone**:> `JobController#releasePayment()`

So after the step 10 (releasing payment) a worker has ETH on his account that he have earned.

### Fixed Price

This type of flow stands for fixed and prediscussed price for any spents of time during the work. So there is no additional or 'ontop' payments after a work was finished. When a worker ends his work a client have to decide if he is good with the result of a work or not, so he could either accept or reject results of work. In case when a client rejects work results then the dispute opens and referee should decide if client right or not. A referee (this role works like escrow accounts) should resolve this dispute by splitting the total balance between participants or give it to either side. 
> Penalty fee could be charged for dispute resolvement.

Algorithm of a job with fixed price flow is:
1. **client**:> `JobController#postJob()`
2. **worker**:> `JobController#postJobOfferWithPrice()`
3. **client**:> `JobController#acceptOffer()`
4. **worker**:> `JobController#startWork()`
5. **worker**:> `JobController#pauseWork()` or `JobController#resumeWork()` (but it is totally optional)
6. **worker**:> `JobController#endWork()`

After that both are possible:

7. **client**:> `JobController#acceptWorkResults()`
8. **anyone**:> `JobController#releasePayment()`

or (when dispute is opened):

7. **client**:> `JobController#rejectWorkResults()`
8. **referee**:> `JobController#resolveWorkDispute()` (here payments are transferred directly to client/worker accounts in provided proportions)


# Structure

Smart contracts by their purpose are divided into several groups:

- [maintenance](#maintenance-contracts) - used to provide security functions, provide centralized access to resources and so on;
- [controllers](#controller-contracts) - define algorithms of how to manage different interactions between entities;
- [user management](#user-management-contracts) - provides a way to incapsulate different roles into the system;
- [payment-related](#payment-related-contracts) - define a flow of locking/releasing user balances during different actions;
- [helpers](#helper-contracts) - used to provide a support for other contracts/external systems, get an additional information.

## Maintenance contracts

#### [Roles2Library](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/Roles2Library.sol)

Managers roles inside the system; provides a tool to configure ACL based on roles. Across the system this library provides authorization for functions that could be protected by different roles.

#### [ContractsManager](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/ContractsManager.sol)

Registry that holds main contracts of the system. A user could get registered contract by associated key.

#### [MultiEventsHistory](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/MultiEventsHistory.sol)

Provides proxy gateway for system's events. Could filter/reject/accept events from any source.

#### [Storage](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/Storage.sol)

Contract that could keep its state in layout-independent way storing them in key:value manner. Every big or complex contract inherits from it.

#### [StorageManager](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/StorageManager.sol)

Manages read/write access into contracts' storage that inherits from Storage contract. Provides a way to divide common Storage into different sections (crates) and protects from unauthorized access.


## Controller contracts

#### [BoardController](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/BoardController.sol)

Organizes boards that could join clients and jobs into separate spaces. Allows to create boards and manage jobs' and users' binding.

#### [JobController](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/JobController.sol)

Provides different flows of how a client could create a job, find a worker, negotiate, track and finish a job. JobController also provides instruments for workers to find a job, apply for it, do something and be rewarded. Create job market.


## User Management contracts

#### [RatingsAndReputationLibrary](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/RatingsAndReputationLibrary.sol)

Provides functionality of feedback from workers and clients. Helps to find more reliable positions in the future. Feedback after work was done.

#### [UserLibrary](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/UserLibrary.sol)

Holds users' data about their skills, areas and categories. Used by UserFactory or separately by authorized user.

#### [UserFactory](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/UserFactory.sol)

Factory to create a new users. Entry point in registration flow. Creates users with defined set of skills in specific areas and categories.

#### [UserProxy](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/UserProxy.sol)

Contract that will be created after user registration and that will be associated with skills, areas, categories. Proxy contract, any action should performed by calling forward function by User contract.

#### [User](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/User.sol)

Contract that a user after registration should interact with to perform actions with JobController and BoardController. Facade to interact with the system.

#### [Recovery](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/Recovery.sol)

Provides functionality to recover an access to a registered user when a user had lost his control over original account. Allows to recover control over a User contract.


## Payment-related contracts

#### [BalanceHolder](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/BalanceHolder.sol)

Holds balances of participants and allows to withdraw only for holders. Used by PaymentGateway as a wallet.

#### [PaymentGateway](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/PaymentGateway.sol)

Performs transfers between different accounts (client, worker, job), setup fees for transactions. Used by PaymentProcessor.

#### [PaymentProcessor](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/PaymentProcessor.sol)

High-order contract to manipulate balances of users. Able to lock balances and release them after specific actions. Could be turned into maintenance state that will not allow any payments except accepted one. Used by JobController to perform payments.


## Helper contracts

#### [JobsDataProvider](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/JobsDataProvider.sol)

Read-only contract, provides getters for JobController state

#### [SkillsLibrary](https://github.com/ChronoBank/LX-SC/blob/master/contracts/SkillsLibrary.sol)

Database, provides functionality for managing user's skills, categories and areas. Stores allowed skills, areas, categories and their descriptions. Access to skills data, categories and areas of the system.
